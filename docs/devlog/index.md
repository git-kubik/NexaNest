# Development Log

This log tracks the development progress of NexaNest, documenting key decisions, implementations, and milestones.

## 2025-05-31 18:40:00 Project Inception and Foundation

### Overview

Today marks the beginning of NexaNest v2.0 development. We've established the foundational architecture
and implemented core components for the AI-powered investment portfolio management platform.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Architecture Design

- Created comprehensive system architecture with microservices design
- Defined technology stack:
  - **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) for AI/ML services, Go for high-performance services
  - **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  - **Databases**: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Redis, OpenSearch
  - **Infrastructure**: Docker Swarm (POC phase), moving to Kubernetes for production

#### 2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Established key architectural decisions:

- **ADR-001**: Microservices architecture for scalability
- **ADR-002**: Python for AI services, Go for performance-critical services
- **ADR-003**: Docker Swarm for POC deployment
- **ADR-004**: Event-driven architecture with Kafka
- **ADR-005**: UV for Python package management
- **ADR-006**: Defer AWS-specific services to future development
- **ADR-007**: Project as Proof of Concept (POC)
- **ADR-008**: PostgreSQL outside Swarm for persistence
- **ADR-009**: Local Docker registry for image storage
- **ADR-010**: MkDocs with Material theme for documentation
- **ADR-011**: Documentation standards with frontmatter and linting

```

#### 4. Authentication Service

Implemented core authentication service with:

- FastAPI-based REST API
- JWT token authentication with refresh tokens
- User roles: USER, ADVISOR, ADMIN, SUPERUSER
- Session management
- OAuth2 compatibility
- MFA support structure
- API key management for service-to-service communication

#### 5. Development Environment

- Docker Compose configuration for local development
- Makefile for common tasks
- Quick start script for easy setup
- Comprehensive .gitignore
- Environment configuration template

#### 6. Documentation Setup

- Configured MkDocs with Material theme
- Added Mermaid diagram support
- Created documentation structure with frontmatter
- Set up for professional documentation site

### Technical Decisions

1. **Package Management**: Switched to `uv` for Python dependency management for better performance and reliability
1. **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL for primary data, TimescaleDB for time-series market data
1. **Caching**: Multi-tier caching with Redis
1. **Security**: JWT-based authentication with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens
1. **API Design**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Balancing POC simplicity with production readiness
   **Solution**: Clear separation of POC features vs. future production features in ADRs

1. **Challenge**: Choosing between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm
   **Solution**: Docker Swarm for POC phase due to existing infrastructure, with clear migration path to Kubernetes

### Next Steps

1. **High Priority**:

   - Configure Docker Swarm deployment scripts
   - Set up local Docker registry
   - Implement portfolio management service
   - Create market data service with WebSocket support

1. **Medium Priority**:

   - Build AI/ML service with LangChain
   - Develop frontend application
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines

1. **Future Considerations**:

   - Migration to Kubernetes
   - AWS service integration
   - Production security hardening

### Metrics

- **Services Implemented**: 1/6 (Authentication)
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80% (not yet measured)
- **Documentation**: Foundation complete
- **API Endpoints**: 5 implemented (auth endpoints)

### Team Notes

- Focus on POC validation before production features
- Maintain clear documentation for all decisions
- Use uv for all Python dependencies
- Follow established ADRs for consistency
