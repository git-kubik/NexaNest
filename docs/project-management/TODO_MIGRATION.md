# TODO Management Migration to GitHub Issues

## Overview

On 2025-06-11, the NexaNest project migrated from local TODO.md file management to GitHub Issues for better project tracking, automation, and visibility.

## Migration Summary

### Issues Created

**Critical Priority (5 issues):**
- #8: Set up PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB containers outside Docker Swarm
- #9: Configure local Docker registry (localhost:5000) 
- #10: Apply database schemas for all services
- #11: Set up basic CI/CD pipeline
- #12: Configure environment variables and secrets management

**High Priority (4 issues):**
- #13: Complete Portfolio Management Service (FastAPI)
- #14: Implement Market Data Service with WebSocket streaming
- #15: Create Frontend Foundation (React 18 + TypeScript)
- #16: Set up API Gateway with Kong

**Medium Priority (1 issue initially created):**
- #17: Implement OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Framework

### Local TODO Archive

The original `TODO.md` file has been archived as `TODO.md.archived` and contains the full historical TODO list with completed items for reference.

## New Project Management Workflow

### Daily Operations
- Use GitHub Issues for all task tracking
- Apply proper labels from `.github/labels.yml`
- Use GitHub Project boards for kanban workflow
- Automated workflows handle status updates

### Commands Updated
- **update-todo**: Now uses GitHub Issues API instead of local file
- **project-status**: Integrated with GitHub issue tracking

### Benefits of Migration

1. **Better Visibility**: Issues are visible to all stakeholders
2. **Automation**: GitHub Actions automatically manage issue lifecycle
3. **Integration**: Issues link to PRs, commits, and project boards
4. **Collaboration**: Team members can comment, assign, and track progress
5. **Reporting**: Built-in GitHub insights and project analytics
6. **Notifications**: Automatic notifications for issue updates

## GitHub Integration Features

### Labeling System
- Priority: critical, high, medium, low
- Type: feature, bug, infrastructure, security
- Component: database, frontend, auth-service, etc.
- Status: ready, in-progress, blocked, done
- Effort: XS, S, M, L, XL

### Project Automation
- Issues automatically move through project board columns
- Status labels update based on PR activity
- Critical issues trigger Slack notifications
- Stale issues are automatically flagged

### Workflow Integration
- Pull requests automatically link to issues
- Issue status updates when PRs are merged
- Automated sprint reporting
- Cycle time tracking

## Access and Usage

### GitHub CLI
```bash
# List critical issues
gh issue list --label="priority: critical"

# Create new issue
gh issue create --title="Issue Title" --body="Description"

# Update issue status
gh issue edit 8 --add-label="status: in-progress"

# Close completed issue
gh issue close 8
```

### GitHub Web Interface
- Navigate to https://github.com/git-kubik/NexaNest/issues
- Use filters for priority, component, status
- Create issues using templates
- Access project boards for kanban view

## Migration Notes

### Preserved Information
- All historical TODO items preserved in archived file
- Recently completed items documented in GitHub issues #1-7
- Project context and notes maintained

### Improved Organization
- Better dependency tracking between issues
- Enhanced search and filtering capabilities
- Integration with development workflow
- Automatic documentation generation

## Next Steps

1. **Team Training**: Ensure all team members understand new workflow
2. **Project Board Setup**: Configure kanban boards per PROJECT_BOARDS_GUIDE.md
3. **Automation Testing**: Verify all GitHub Actions workflows function correctly
4. **Regular Reviews**: Weekly review of issue priorities and status
