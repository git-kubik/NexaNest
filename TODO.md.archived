## üìù Notes

### Current Phase: Infrastructure & Planning (Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2)
- **Focus**: Database setup and core service development preparation
- **Timeline**: 16-week implementation plan, currently in weeks 4-5
- **Next Phase**: Core services development (Portfolio, Market Data, Frontend)

### Recent Major Accomplishments
- **Project Management System**: Complete GitHub-based PM system with automation
- **Database Architecture**: Comprehensive schema design for all services
- **Documentation Framework**: Professional templates and standards established
- **GitHub Integration**: Issue tracking, workflows, and project automation ready

### Technical Decisions
- **Deployment**: Docker Swarm for POC, Kubernetes migration planned for production
- **Timestamps**: Australia/Adelaide timezone standardized across all components (ADR-012)
- **API Design**: API-first approach with OpenAPI documentation
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage target
- **Database**: PostgreSQL runs outside Swarm for data persistence, schemas documented
- **Registry**: Local Docker registry (localhost:5000) required for Swarm deployment
- **Instrumentation**: Configurable OpenTelemetry framework (ADR-013)

### Development Priorities
1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Database deployment with new schemas is immediate blocker
2. **Core Services**: Portfolio Management implementation can begin once DB is ready
3. **Real-time Data**: WebSocket implementation critical for user experience
4. **Frontend**: Basic dashboard needed to demonstrate POC value
5. **Monitoring**: Instrumentation framework setup for production readiness

### Performance Requirements
- API response time: <100ms (p95)
- Dashboard load time: <2 seconds  
- Real-time updates: <500ms latency
- Scale target: 10,000+ concurrent users

### New Focus Areas
- **Database Implementation**: Moving from schema design to actual deployment
- **Project Management**: Established comprehensive GitHub-based system
- **Documentation Standards**: Professional templates and processes in place
- **Instrumentation Planning**: ADR-013 defines comprehensive monitoring approach
