Project Management Setup for Cloud Services Delivery

I'm a Delivery Lead for Cloud Services and need to establish a comprehensive GitHub-based system for project management. Please provide a detailed implementation guide covering:

## Primary Requirements:

**Issue Management:**
- Create standardized issue templates for bugs, feature requests, scope changes, and technical debt
- Establish a labeling system that supports prioritization, categorization, and workflow stages
- Set up automated issue routing and assignment rules

**Scope Change Documentation:**
- Design a process for documenting scope changes with impact analysis
- Create templates that capture business justification, effort estimates, and stakeholder approval
- Establish linking between scope changes and related work items

**Work Progress Tracking:**
- Configure GitHub Projects with custom views (kanban, timeline, table)
- Set up automation rules for moving items through workflow stages
- Create dashboards for stakeholder visibility into project status

**Documentation Strategy:**
- Structure wiki pages for architectural decisions, runbooks, and project documentation
- Implement markdown templates for consistent documentation standards
- Set up automated documentation generation where possible

## Specific Deliverables Needed:

1. **Issue Templates** - Ready-to-use markdown templates for each issue type
2. **Label Taxonomy** - Complete labeling scheme with descriptions and color coding
3. **Project Board Configuration** - Step-by-step setup for automated project boards
4. **Workflow Automation** - GitHub Actions or built-in automations for common tasks
5. **Reporting Views** - Custom project views for different stakeholder needs
6. **Integration Guidelines** - How to connect with external tools (Slack, Jira, etc.)

## Context:
- Team size: [specify your team size]
- Project types: Cloud infrastructure, migrations, platform services
- Stakeholders: Engineering teams, product managers, executives
- Current tools: [list any existing tools you need to integrate with]

Please provide practical examples, code snippets for automation, and best practices specific to cloud services delivery management.
